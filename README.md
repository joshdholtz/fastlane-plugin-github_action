## About github_action

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) makes it easy to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub. However, setting up [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) to work with [match](https://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/match/#match) on GitHub Actions can take bit of juggling and manual work :pensive:

But `fastlane-plugin-github_action` to the rescue :muscle:

This plugin will:

### 1. Prompt you if `setup_ci` is not found in your `Fastfile`
Running _fastlane_ on a CI requires the environment to be setup properly. Calling the [setup_ci](http://docs.fastlane.tools/actions/setup_ci/#setup_ci) action does that by configuring a new keychain that will be used for code signing with _match_

### 2. Create a Deploy Key on your _match_ repository to be used from your GitHub Action
A [Deploy Key](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/managing-deploy-keys/) is needed for GitHub Actions to access your _match_ repository. This action creates a new SSH key and uses the public key for the Deploy Key on your _match_ repository.

This will only get executed if the `match_org` and `match_repo` options are specified.

### 3. Set the Deploy Key private key in secrets (along with secrets in your [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) file(s)
The private key created for the Deploy Key is store encrypted in your [repository secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets). The private key is stored under the name `MATCH_DEPLOY_KEY`. 

Encrypted secrets will also get set for environment variables from [dotenv](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv) files specified by the `dotenv_paths` option.

### 4. Generate a Workflow YAML file to use
A Workflow YAML file is created at `.github/workflows/fastlane.yml`. This will enable your repository to start running GitHub Actions right away - once committed and pushed :wink:. The Workflow YAML template will add the Deploy Key private key into the GitHub Action by loading it from the `MATCH_DEPLOY_KEY` secret and executing `ssh-add`. All of your other encrypted secrets will also be loaded into environment variables for you as well. 

An example can be [seen here](https://github.com/joshdholtz/test-repo-for-fastlane-plugin-github_action/blob/add-github-action/.github/workflows/fastlane.yml).

## Getting Started

This project is a [_fastlane_](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane) plugin. To get started with `fastlane-plugin-github_action`, add it to your project by running:

```bash
fastlane add_plugin github_action
```

### Requirements

`fastlane-plugin-github_action` depends on [rbnacl](https://github.com/RubyCrypto/rbnacl) which uses [libsodium](https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium)

For macOS, libsodium can be installed with:

```sh
brew install libsodium
```

See https://github.com/RubyCrypto/rbnacl/wiki/Installing-libsodium for more installation instructions.

## Usage

`fastlane-plugin-github_action` can be execute either direction on the command line with `bundle exec fastlane run github_action` or by adding `github_action` to your `Fastfile`.

### CLI

```sh
bundle exec fastlane run github_action \
  api_token:"your-github-personal-access-token-with-all-repo-permissions" \
  org:"your-org" \
  repo:"your-repo"
```

or

```sh
bundle exec fastlane run github_action \
  api_token:"your-github-personal-access-token-with-all-repo-permissions" \
  org:"your-org" \
  repo:"your-repo" \
  match_org:"your-match-repo-org" \
  match_repo:"your-match-repo" \
  dotenv_paths:"fastlane/.env.secret,fastlane/.env.secret2"
```

### In `Fastfile`

```ruby
lane :init_ci do
  github_action(
    api_token: "your-github-personal-access-token-with-all-repo-permissions",
    org: "your-org",
    repo: "your-repo",
    match_org: "your-match-repo-org", # optional
    match_repo: "your-match-repo", # optional
    dotenv_paths: ["fastlane/.env.secret", "fastlane/.env.secret2"] # optional
  )
end
```
